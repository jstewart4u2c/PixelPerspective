**About Pixel Perspective**
- Pixel Perspective is a video game review site that also functions as a social media. Users can create and edit an account, search games, add them to their library, and review them. Added games and written reviews will show up dynamically on the user's profile page. This was designed as a capstone project and is maintained by a team of three.
